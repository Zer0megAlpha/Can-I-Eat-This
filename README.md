# Can-I-Eat-This
When a user wants to find out if a certain food contains possible allergens such as gluten, soy, shellfish, fish, dairy, tree nuts or any other kind of possible allergen, they can simply ask Google Home "Is there gluten in Hersheys?" and it'll return with statements confirming or denying the presence of the allergen. You can ask "Is there milk in cheetos?" or "Is there dairy in nacho cheese?". The list goes on! You can use ask multi word ingredients like "Can I eat caesar salad if I'm allergic to green peppers?". Even goofy questions like "Is there chocolate in chocolate?". Oooh, the possibilities!
